# üö® SMS FALLBACK MODE - FIX GUIDE

**Date:** October 24, 2025, 10:08 AM  
**Issue:** SMS going to fallback mode (console only, not actually sending)  
**Root Cause:** GSM module failed to connect to COM12 at server startup  
**Status:** üî¥ **NEEDS SERVER RESTART**

---

## üîç WHAT'S HAPPENING

Your server logs show:
```
[SMS Notification Service] SMS service not healthy, using fallback mode
[SMS Notification Service] GSM module not ready, using fallback mode
================================================================================
 SMS NOTIFICATION (FALLBACK MODE)  ‚Üê NOT REAL SMS!
================================================================================
 To: 09606388228
 Message: MANUAL TASK: Bin bin1 at Central Plaza...
 Time: 10/24/2025, 10:07:44 AM
================================================================================
```

**This means:**
- ‚úÖ Task assignment works
- ‚úÖ SMS service is called
- ‚úÖ Message is formatted
- ‚ùå **SMS is NOT actually sent** (just logged to console)
- ‚ùå Janitor does NOT receive SMS on phone

---

## üéØ ROOT CAUSE

### GSM Module Not Connected:
```json
{
  "isConnected": false,
  "isInitialized": false,
  "lastError": "Failed to connect to GSM module after 3 attempts",
  "healthStatus": "unhealthy"
}
```

### Why COM12 Failed:
```
‚ùå Failed to open COM12: Opening COM12: Access denied
```

**Translation:**
1. When server started, it tried to connect to COM12
2. COM12 was already being used by another process
3. Server gave up after 3 attempts
4. Server continued running WITHOUT GSM (fallback mode)
5. All SMS attempts now go to console instead of GSM module

---

## ‚úÖ THE FIX

### Quick Fix (Use the Batch File):
```batch
RESTART-SERVER-FOR-SMS.bat
```

This will:
1. Kill all Node.js processes
2. Release COM12
3. Restart server with GSM support
4. Open in new window so you can watch initialization

### Manual Fix:
```batch
# Step 1: Kill all Node processes
taskkill /F /IM node.exe

# Step 2: Wait 5 seconds
timeout /t 5

# Step 3: Restart server
node server/index.js
```

## üîç VERIFICATION

### After Restart, Watch Console For:

**‚úÖ SUCCESS MESSAGES:**
```
[GSM SERVICE] Initializing GSM service...
[GSM SERVICE] Connection attempt 1/3 to COM12...
[GSM SERVICE] Successfully connected to COM12
[GSM SERVICE] Port opened successfully
[GSM SERVICE] Modem initialized successfully
[GSM SERVICE] SIM card is ready
[GSM SERVICE] Signal strength: 15/31 (0-31 scale)
‚úÖ SMS notification service initialized
```

**‚ùå FAILURE MESSAGES (Bad):**
```
[GSM SERVICE] Connection attempt 1/3 failed: Access denied
[GSM SERVICE] Connection attempt 2/3 failed: Access denied
[GSM SERVICE] Connection attempt 3/3 failed: Access denied
[GSM SERVICE] All connection attempts failed
‚ö†Ô∏è GSM module not available - SMS will use fallback mode
```

---

## üß™ TEST SMS AFTER RESTART

### Step 1: Verify GSM Status
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/test/gsm-service/status
```

**Expected:**
```json
{
  "isConnected": true,
  "isInitialized": true,
  "simStatus": "ready",
  "signalStrength": 10-31,
  "healthStatus": "healthy"
}
```

### Step 2: Test Assignment
1. Go to dashboard
2. Click bin1 (Central Plaza)
3. Assign to Josh Canillas (09606388228)
4. Add note: "Test after restart"
5. Click "Assign Task"

### Step 3: Check Console Logs
**‚úÖ SUCCESS (Real SMS):**
```
[JANITOR NOTIFICATION] Sending SMS notification to janitor: 8ESFki0Q3xi1aqsZcVCA
[SMS Notification Service] Preparing manual task SMS for janitor...
[SMS Notification Service] SMS attempt 1/3
[SMS Notification Service] Sending real SMS via GSM module...
[GSM SERVICE] Sending SMS to +639606388228...
[GSM SERVICE] SMS sent successfully via GSM module
[SMS Notification Service] Manual task SMS sent successfully
```

**‚ùå FAILURE (Fallback Mode):**
```
[SMS Notification Service] GSM module not ready, using fallback mode
================================================================================
 SMS NOTIFICATION (FALLBACK MODE)
================================================================================
```

### Step 4: Check Phone
- ‚úÖ SMS should arrive within 10 seconds
- ‚úÖ Message format: "MANUAL TASK: Bin bin1 at Central Plaza | 30% NORMAL..."

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue 1: Still Getting "Access Denied" After Restart

**Possible Causes:**
- Another program is using COM12 (Arduino IDE, PuTTY, etc.)
- GSM test server still running
- Permission issue

**Solutions:**
```batch
# Check what's using COM12
tasklist | findstr node

# Kill everything
taskkill /F /IM node.exe
taskkill /F /IM arduino.exe
taskkill /F /IM putty.exe

# Check Device Manager
# Open Device Manager ‚Üí Ports (COM & LPT)
# Verify "USB-SERIAL CH340 (COM12)" is present
```

### Issue 2: GSM Connects But SIM Not Ready

**Console Shows:**
```
[GSM SERVICE] Successfully connected to COM12
[GSM SERVICE] Error initializing modem
[GSM SERVICE] SIM card issue - check insertion and PIN
```

**Solutions:**
1. Check SIM card is properly inserted
2. Check SIM has credit
3. Check SIM doesn't require PIN
4. Try reinserting SIM card

**Test SIM:**
```bash
node test-sim-detection.js
```

---

### Issue 3: SMS Sends But Not Received

**Console Shows:**
```
[GSM SERVICE] SMS sent successfully via GSM module
[GSM SERVICE] SMS send result: { status: 'success' ... }
```

**But phone doesn't receive SMS.**

**Possible Causes:**
- Wrong SMSC (should be Globe: +639180000101)
- Multi-part SMS issue (Error 325)
- Network issue

**Check Message Format:**
```
[SMS FORMAT] Final message (127 chars): MANUAL TASK: Bin bin1...
```

**Should be:**
- ‚úÖ Under 140 characters
- ‚úÖ Single line (no newlines)
- ‚úÖ ASCII characters only

**Test Direct SMS:**
```bash
node send-test-sms.js
```

---

## üìä CURRENT MESSAGE FORMAT

Your updated format (from logs):
```
MANUAL TASK: Bin bin1 at Central Plaza | 30% NORMAL W:0.019kg H:60% | By Josh Canillas 10/24 10:07 | fdhdfghjfghfd | Empty now!
```

**Length:** 127 characters ‚úÖ  
**Format:** Single line with pipe separators ‚úÖ  
**ASCII:** Yes ‚úÖ  
**Should work:** Yes ‚úÖ

## üîÑ PREVENTION

### To Avoid This Issue:

1. **Don't run multiple servers:**
   - ‚ùå Main server + GSM test server = COM12 conflict
   - ‚úÖ Run ONLY main server for production

2. **Close other serial programs:**
   - Arduino IDE
   - PuTTY
   - Serial Monitor
   - Any other COM port tools

3. **Proper shutdown:**
   - Use Ctrl+C to stop server (not just close window)
   - Wait for "Server closed" message
   - This releases COM12 properly

4. **Check before starting:**
   ```bash
   # Check if COM12 is available
   node check-com-port-usage.js
   
   # Should show: "Successfully opened COM12"
   ```

---

## üéâ SUMMARY

**Problem:** GSM module not connected ‚Üí SMS goes to fallback mode  
**Cause:** COM12 was locked when server started  
**Solution:** Restart server to reconnect to COM12  
**Prevention:** Don't run multiple servers, close serial programs  

**Quick Fix:**
```batch
RESTART-SERVER-FOR-SMS.bat
```

**Verification:**
- Console shows "Successfully connected to COM12"
- Console shows "SMS sent successfully via GSM module"
- Phone receives actual SMS
