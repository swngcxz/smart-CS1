# üö® SMS NOT WORKING - DIAGNOSIS REPORT

**Date:** October 23, 2025, 3:00 PM  
**Issue:** SMS not being sent when assigning tasks from dashboard or activity logs  
**Status:** üî¥ **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**

---

## üîç INVESTIGATION SUMMARY

### Test Results:
1. ‚úÖ Server is running (port 8000)
2. ‚úÖ Assignment endpoint works (`/api/assign-task`)
3. ‚úÖ Activity log created successfully
4. ‚úÖ Task assigned to janitor successfully
5. ‚ùå **SMS NOT SENT**

### Root Cause:
```
GSM Module Status:
  - isConnected: false ‚ùå
  - isInitialized: false ‚ùå
  - lastError: "Failed to connect to GSM module after 3 attempts"
  - healthStatus: "unhealthy" ‚ùå
```

**The GSM module failed to connect to COM12 when the server started!**

---

## üéØ THE PROBLEM

### COM12 Port Conflict
```
Error: Opening COM12: Access denied
```

**What this means:**
- COM12 is physically connected ‚úÖ
- COM12 is detected by Windows ‚úÖ
- COM12 is already being used by another process ‚ùå

**Most likely culprit:**
The **GSM Test Server** (gsm-test-server.js) is still running and has COM12 locked!

### How This Happens:
1. You ran `start-gsm-test-admin.bat` earlier to test SMS
2. GSM test server opened COM12
3. You started the main server (server/index.js)
4. Main server tried to open COM12 ‚Üí Access Denied
5. Main server continues running WITHOUT GSM connection
6. All task assignments work, but SMS fails silently

## üìä CURRENT STATE

### Running Node Processes (5 total):
```
node.exe     13848    ~30 MB
node.exe     12052   ~102 MB  ‚Üê Likely main server
node.exe     16728    ~31 MB
node.exe      5372   ~153 MB
node.exe      7852    ~58 MB
```

**One of these is holding COM12!**

### Available Janitors (verified working):
```
- Glendon Rose Marie: 09766262752
- John Lee: 09972369650
- Josh Canillas: 09606388228
- John Jerald: 09309096606 ‚Üê Your phone
- Angel Canete: 09950913018
```

### SMS Service Status:
```
Total SMS Sent: 4 (from earlier tests)
Total SMS Failed: 0
Success Rate: 100%
Last Error: "Failed to connect to GSM module after 3 attempts"
```

**Translation:** SMS *was* working earlier (4 successful sends), but now GSM is disconnected.

---

## ‚úÖ THE SOLUTION

### Step 1: Kill All Node.js Processes
```batch
taskkill /F /IM node.exe
```

**This will close:**
- Main server (server/index.js)
- GSM test server (gsm-test-server.js) ‚Üê The culprit
- Any other Node processes
- **COM12 will be released**

### Step 2: Start ONLY the Main Server
```batch
node server/index.js
```

**OR use the batch file I created:**
```batch
restart-main-server-only.bat
```

### Step 3: Verify GSM Connection
Watch the console for:
```
[GSM SERVICE] Initializing GSM service...
[GSM SERVICE] Successfully connected to COM12
[GSM SERVICE] Modem initialized successfully
[GSM SERVICE] SIM card is ready
‚úÖ SMS notification service initialized
```

**If you see this, SMS is working!**

### Step 4: Test Task Assignment
1. Go to dashboard ‚Üí Bin1 (Central Plaza)
2. Click bin ‚Üí Assign to Janitor
3. Select: John Jerald (09309096606)
4. Add note: "Test SMS after restart"
5. Click "Assign Task"

**Expected result:**
- Console shows: `[SMS NOTIFICATION SERVICE] SMS sent successfully`
- Your phone receives SMS within 10 seconds

## üîß PREVENTION

### Don't Run Both Servers Simultaneously!

**Choose ONE:**

#### Option A: Main Server (Production Use)
```batch
node server/index.js
```
- Full app functionality
- GSM/SMS enabled
- Dashboard, bins, activity logs
- **Port 8000**

#### Option B: GSM Test Server (Testing Only)
```batch
start-gsm-test-admin.bat
```
- GSM testing only
- Web interface for SMS tests
- No main app features
- **Port 8081**

**‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER RUN BOTH AT THE SAME TIME!**

## üìã VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

After restarting the server, verify:

- [ ] All Node processes killed (`taskkill /F /IM node.exe`)
- [ ] Main server started (`node server/index.js`)
- [ ] Console shows "GSM service initialized"
- [ ] Console shows "SMS notification service initialized"
- [ ] GSM status endpoint shows healthy:
  ```
  GET http://localhost:8000/api/test/gsm-service/status
  ‚Üí isConnected: true
  ‚Üí isInitialized: true
  ‚Üí healthStatus: "healthy"
  ```
- [ ] Assign task from dashboard
- [ ] SMS received on phone

## üß™ TESTING COMMANDS

### Check Server Status:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### Check GSM Status:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/test/gsm-service/status
```

### Check SMS Service:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/test/sms-service/status
```

### Test Complete Flow:
```bash
node test-assignment-flow.js
```

## üì± EXPECTED SMS FORMAT

When task assignment works, janitor should receive:

```
MANUAL TASK: bin1 @ Central Plaza. Level:100% (CRITICAL). W:0kg H:100%. Note: Test SMS after restart. By Josh Canillas 10/23/2025, 03:15 PM. Empty now
```

**Message Details:**
- Assignment type: MANUAL
- Bin: bin1 at Central Plaza
- Level: 100% (CRITICAL status)
- Weight & Height sensors
- Task note (if provided)
- Assigned by (staff name)
- Timestamp
- Call to action: "Empty now"

---

## üîç DEBUGGING TIPS

### If SMS Still Doesn't Work After Restart:

1. **Check Console Logs:**
   ```
   Look for:
   [JANITOR NOTIFICATION] Sending SMS notification...
   [SMS NOTIFICATION SERVICE] SMS Message prepared
   [GSM SERVICE] Sending SMS to +639309096606...
   [GSM SERVICE] SMS sent successfully ‚Üê You want to see this!
   ```

2. **Check for Errors:**
   ```
   [GSM SERVICE] Error: ... ‚Üê Bad!
   [SMS NOTIFICATION SERVICE] SMS failed ‚Üê Bad!
   ```

3. **Verify COM Port:**
   ```bash
   node check-com-port-usage.js
   ```
   Should show: "Successfully opened COM12"

4. **Check SIM Card:**
   ```bash
   node test-sim-detection.js
   ```
   Should show: "SIM Status: READY"

5. **Manual SMS Test:**
   ```bash
   node send-test-sms.js
   ```
   Should send test SMS to your phone

## üìû WHAT HAPPENS IN THE BACKGROUND

When you click "Assign Task":

```
1. Frontend (Dashboard/Activity Logs)
   ‚Üì POST /api/activitylogs
2. Server creates activity log (status: pending)
   ‚Üì Returns activity_id
3. Frontend extracts activity_id
   ‚Üì POST /api/assign-task
4. Server updates activity (status: in_progress)
   ‚Üì Calls sendJanitorAssignmentNotification()
5. Controller fetches janitor details
   ‚Üì Gets contactNumber from Firestore
6. Controller fetches bin data
   ‚Üì Gets real-time weight, height, level from RTDB
7. SMS Service formats message
   ‚Üì Creates compact single-line message
8. GSM Service sends SMS
   ‚Üì Uses COM12 ‚Üí GPRS 800C ‚Üí Globe SMSC
9. Janitor receives SMS
   ‚úÖ "MANUAL TASK: bin1 @ Central Plaza..."
```

**Currently failing at step 8** because COM12 is not connected!

---

## üéØ SUMMARY

**Problem:** GSM module not connected when main server started  
**Cause:** COM12 already in use by GSM test server  
**Solution:** Kill all Node processes, restart main server only  
**Prevention:** Never run both servers simultaneously  

**Quick Fix:**
```batch
# Kill everything
taskkill /F /IM node.exe

# Wait 3 seconds
timeout /t 3

# Restart main server
node server/index.js

# Wait for "SMS notification service initialized"
# Then test assignment
```
